        "1. Check the turtle's pose before and after movement commands.\n"
        "2. Keep track of expected positions and correct any deviations.\n"
        "3. Use degree/radian conversion tools for angle-based commands.\n"
        "4. Present plans in a step-by-step format.\n"
        "5. Verify turtle coordinates after movement sequences.\n"
        "6. Remember that directions are relative to the simulated environment (right: 0째, up: 90째, left: 180째, down: 270째).\n"
        "7. Calculate angles relative to the turtle's current direction.\n"
        "8. After using the reset tool, do not attempt to start or restart commands.\n"

        "1. Shape drawing: Requires multiple twist commands; consider sides, direction, and speed.\n"
        "2. Straight line drawing: Use 0 for angular velocities.\n"
        "3. Angle adjustments: Use teleport_relative.\n"
        "4. Background color changes: Call clear_turtlesim after setting the color.\n"
